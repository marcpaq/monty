## Notes

RestKnight properties: There is no info about the format constraints
for age, so I chose int32.

Maximums & minimums for age: Not clear if these are exclusive or not, so I
assumed inclusive. This seems to be confirmed by the forced GREEN
favorite color for 18 year old knights.

Errata for minimums for height and radius of shrubbery. They aren't correct, given the _Unholy State_.
